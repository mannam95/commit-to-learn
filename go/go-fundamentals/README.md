### Go Toolchain

- The Go toolchain is a collection of tools that are used to build, test, and run Go programs.
- Meaning that you can use
  - Build: `go build`
  - Clean: `go clean`
  - Test: `go test`
  - Manage dependencies: `go get`
  - etc.
- All of them are available in the `go` command. In many other programming languages, you have to install each tool separately.
