# Go Toolchain

The Go toolchain is a collection of tools that are used to build, test, and run Go programs.

Meaning that you can use:

- Build: `go build`
- Clean: `go clean`
- Test: `go test`
- Manage dependencies: `go get`
- etc.

All of them are available in the `go` command. In many other programming languages, you have to install each tool separately.
