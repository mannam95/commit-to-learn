# Constants in Go

- Constants are declared using the `const` keyword.
- They hold values that cannot be changed during program execution.
- They can be character, string, boolean, or numeric values.
- Constants cannot be declared using the `:=` syntax.

```go
const PI = 3.14
const (
    A = 1
    B = 2
)
```
